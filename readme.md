<p>The aim of the project consists in maintaining the required value of the regulated quantity, its monitoring or measuring according to a definite program that is either pre-set, or specified during system operation depending on certain conditions and with the achievement of comfort and minimum energy consumption.</p>
<p>The project involves several parameters related to building infrastructure and security systems. These parameters include HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning), Lighting Control System, Firefighting System, Access Control System, Intrusion Detection, Smart Parking, Water Management System, and live CCTV footage. The lighting and HVAC systems can be controlled remotely. Additionally, there is an automated emergency situation handling mechanism with manual control override. The control and monitoring of all parameters are achieved using an ATmega2560 Microcontroller, while data acquisition and monitoring are handled by a Raspberry Pi, an Embedded Development Board.</p>
